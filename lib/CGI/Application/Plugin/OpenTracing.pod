=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Plugin::OpenTracing - Use OpenTracing in CGI Applications



=head1 SYNOPSIS

Inside your own CGI Application:

    package MyCGI;
    
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    use base qw/CGI::Application/;
    
    use CGI::Application::Plugin::OpenTracing;

After Setup, before Run, initialize the Global Tracer with the following
callback:

    sub opentracing_implementation {
        my $webapp = shift;
        my $run_mode = $webapp->get_current_runmode();
        my $run_method = { $webapp->run_modes }->{ $run_mode };
        
        
        return ( 'SomeImplementation' =>
            default_context => {
                
                # implentation specific settings
                #
                service_name    => __PACKAGE__,
                service_type    => 'web',
                resource_name   => 'test.cgi',
                
                # any key/values that will be carried over to child spans
                #
                baggage_items   => {
                    run_mode        => $run_mode,
                    run_method      => $run_method,
                }
                
            },
        );
        
    }



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will use the return value from the C<opentracing_implementation>
callback to bootstrap a L<OpenTracing::GlobalTracer>, with
L<OpenTracing::Implementation>. It uses all the parameters as mentioned in that
C<set> method.

It will automatically create a new tracer, with a total of four spans:

=over

=item cgi_application

This is the root span, wich will have a start time at the beginning of the cgi
request, and last till the entire request will be finished.

=back

On top of this rootspan, the following three child-spans will be created:

=over

=item setup

A childspan, that will take the duration of the entire setup process.

=item run

After the tracer has been setup (using the information from the callback), this
span will be started for the actual duration of the request handling

=item teardown

OOPS C<...> not implemented (yet)

=back



=head1 ADDING DEEPER INSTRUMENTATION

This plugin only initiates the tracer, and three childspans. For more detail at
deeper call levels, one would need the L<OpenTracing::GlobalTracer> and add
manual instrumentation using C<start_active_span>:

    use OpenTracing::GlobalTracer qw/$TRACER/;

and later per subroutine:

    sub foo {
        my $opentracing_scope = $TRACER->start_active_span( foo => \%options );
        
        ...
        
        $opentracing_scope->close( )
    }

Alternatively, on can use L<OpenTracing::AutoScope>, which handles all the work
in one go:

    use OpenTracing::AutoScope;

and later per subroutine:

    sub foo {
        OpenTracing::AutoScope->start_guarded_span;
        
        ...
        
    }

Lastly, use L<OpenTracing::Wrap>, to automagically wrap scopes and traces around
a list of mentioned (fully qualified) subroutine names.

=head1 CAVEATS

Probably a few...

Originally, OpenTracing Implementations should extract any context and build new
spans based on that. Sadly, no implementations are providing these features.

Since the tracer is only initialised, right before 'run' phase, it is useless to
even try to add deeper level of instrumentation during 'setup'. Those will use
the default L<OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp> which ... does nothing.

Traces will get lost, when the rootspan is not closed properly.
